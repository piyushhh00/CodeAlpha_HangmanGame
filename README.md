# Hangman Game

A classic Hangman word guessing game implemented in one version: a command-line version using Python.

Hangman is a word guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure is drawn. The player wins by guessing all the letters in the word before the complete hangman figure is drawn (6 incorrect guesses).
